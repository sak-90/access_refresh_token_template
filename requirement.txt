1. Database Setup

Initialize a MongoDB database to store user data and session information.
Create two collections: `users` and `sessions` to store user data and session information, respectively.
Implement the necessary fields in the `users` collection, including but not limited to:
`_id` (Unique Identifier)
`email` (Unique)
`password` (Hashed)
`name`
Implement the necessary fields in the `sessions` collection, including but not limited to:
`_id` (Unique Identifier)
`userId` (Reference to the `users` collection)
token`
`createdAt` (Timestamp)

2. User Registration

Create an API endpoint that allows users to register by providing their email, password, and name.
Implement password hashing to securely store user passwords in the database.
Validate user input, ensuring that:
Email is in a valid format.
Password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
Return a unique session token upon successful registration and store it in the `sessions` collection.

3. User Login

Create an API endpoint that allows registered users to log in using their email and password.
Verify the provided email and password against the stored user data.
Return a unique session token upon successful login and store it in the `sessions` collection.

4. User Logout

Create an API endpoint that allows users to log out, invalidating their session token.
Ensure that a user can have multiple sessions and can log out of a specific session while remaining logged in on other devices.

5. Session Management
Implement session management to handle token expiration and re-authentication.
Ensure session tokens have a limited lifespan (e.g., 24 hours).
Implement a token refresh mechanism to extend session validity.

6. Authentication Middleware

Create a middleware to authenticate API requests.
Ensure that protected routes can only be accessed by users with a valid session token.

7. Error Handling

Implement error handling for common authentication-related issues (e.g., invalid credentials, expired tokens, validation errors).
Return meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.

8. Testing

Write unit and integration tests for the authentication system using testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest.
Include test cases for user registration, login, logout, session management, and error scenarios.

9. Documentation

Provide clear API documentation for endpoints and authentication flows.
Include instructions for developers on how to use the authentication system.
